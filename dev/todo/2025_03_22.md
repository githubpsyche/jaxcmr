What do I actually want to prioritize right now?

It looks like I'm interested in moving the cru_to_cmr repo to my current research repository.

I've found that much of the code there doesn't work independently of other code in other repos, and also it's quite disorganized. So this could be a good opportunity to clean it up and make it more modular.

But I shouldn't prioritize this stuff too much. I should maybe create a task list and do stuff "along the way" as I work on high priority tasks that overlap with this cru_to_cmr repo.

Or more like a path analysis.

If I want the parameter shifting notebook to work using only code from my repo, I need to port behavioral analyses into my repo.

But why do I want to port the parameter shifting notebook? Within the context of the cru_to_cmr project, the answer is obvious: that's part of the project. 

Overall, parameter shifting works within my overall model development workflow to validate and demonstrate parametrized model mechanisms, a key step before testing whether the demonstrated mechanism helps address the research question of interest.

What again was that model development workflow?

1. Identify a research question of interest
2. Identify a model mechanism that could help address the research question
3. Implement the mechanism in a model
4. In the parameter shifting notebook, demonstrate that the mechanism works how I expect it to as values of the parameters are shifted.
5. Then fit the model with the mechanism to data, and see if it helps address the research question of interest over the baseline model without the mechanism.
6. If it does, then I can conclude that the mechanism is a good candidate for addressing the research question of interest.
7. I'll either publish the model or test it further.

Cool, whatever.

compmemlearn has implementations fo analyses in numba and also some demo notebooks but no tests.
compmempy has a benchmark_analyses notebook that groups analysis variants together for demonstration. That's probably fine, to be honest. And some pretty detailed tests.
compmempy0 has full literate programming notebooks for each analysis variant which seem light on tests. 
jaxcmr_research has some test notebooks for SPC and other analyses. Probably the best starting point for literate programming of the analysis variants.

This took too long. I should try to speed this up somehow...
Let's do the PNR one using chatgpt since it's so similar.
