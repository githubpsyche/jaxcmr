Which for this draft?
Transposition gradient?
Serial position curve?
Anything else?

Serial position effects for sure. 
Probability of responding with the correct item in the correct position is okay.
Then transposition gradient.  Observed and predicted probabilities of reporting items in the correct position (0), positions before (negative values), and positions after (positive values).

Observed and predicted lag conditional recall probabilities as a function of task and list length. 

If focused on the factorial comparison, I should emphasize analyses that might show off mechanisms sensitive either to CRU or to CMR. 

It looks like it's there to predict a certain kind of error...

> In each experiment, the tasks were compared on seven standard measures of serial report: list accuracy, serial position effects, transposition gradients, contiguity effects, error magnitudes, error types, and error ratios.

I guess confusion errors are something that could be captured by something like a distance CRP. But that's not quite what's used in the paper.

I can look at error types?
Gordn used...
order, intrusion, and omission errors.
CMR can't predict intrusions, so that's the highest priority.
Order errors can be predicted by confusion errors.
And omission errors could be a consequence of prior errors. 

How do I measure these?
Is like the serial recall accuracy curve, except counting errors instead of accuracies. 
And specifically identifying error *types*. 
An intrusion will be an item that is not in the list, but is reported.
An omission will be an item that is in the list, but is not reported.
An order error will be an item that is in the list, but is reported in the wrong position.

Next problem to figure out is...loss function.
