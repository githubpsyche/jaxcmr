    "## Initial Approach\n",
    "\n",
    "<!-- In our Repetition Lag-CRP analysis, we included a `should_tabulate` function that focused consideration of transitions from items with at least two spaced-out study positions. In this analysis, we instead identify transitions from +1 and +2 neighbors of any study positions of repeatedly studied items, $S_i = {i + 1, i + 2}$ or $S_j = {j + 1, j + 2}$ where $i$ and $j$ identify the study positions of the repeated items.\n",
    "\n",
    "In our Repetition Lag-CRP analysis, in our `tabulate` function, we tracked actual versus possible transitions to different serial lags from the last recalled item. In this analysis, we instead focus on tracking actual and possible transitions from items in the $S_i$ or $S_j$ sets to their corresponding $S_j$ or $S_i$ sets, respectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "Under this analysis, the key challenge of the analysis is consistently identifying applicable $S_i$ and $S_j$ sets across recall transitions in a tabulation.\n",
    "To accomplish this, at initialization of the tabulation, we track for each studied item the study position(s) of the item studied immediately before it, as well as of the item studied two study positions before it. \n",
    "\n",
    "When either the last or second-to-last studied item has multiple study positions, the considered item is part of an $S_i$ or $S_j$ set.\n",
    "\n",
    "No, I think we can be more efficient than this.\n",
    "When we get to a recall event, that can be an item with multiple study positions.\n",
    "When we consider the next recall event, it can also be an item with multiple study positions.\n",
    "For all applicable study positions of both transitioned-from and transitioned-to items, we should identify the items studied one or two study positions before them.\n",
    "If these sets intersect and the two items are not themselves neighbors, then that's a transition between $S_i$ and $S_j$. -->"
