    "## Setting Up Control Analyses\n",
    "\n",
    "> To control for the proportion of transitions expected in the absence of repeated items, we assigned the same serial positions used in the mixed lists to corresponding items in the control lists. For each subject, we assigned these positions to 100 random shuffles of the control lists, and took the mean across lists to get a baseline expectation of remote transitions.\n",
    "\n",
    "A control analysis is essential for measuring the effect of repeated items on transitions.\n",
    "In the full control analysis, we apply the analysis on 100 random shuffles of these control trial vectors per subject in order to get a baseline expectation of remote transitions.\n",
    "Here we specify an implementation that works reasonably for given pairings of control trial response vectors and mixed list presentation vectors.\n",
    "\n",
    "An important consideration that strongly affects analysis results is whether for an item studied in a mixed list at two positions, recall of items in control lists at *either* position count for the purposes of tabulating transitions between $S_i$ and $S_j$, or just the item in the study positions specified by $S_i$ or $S_j$.\n",
    "If we accept that both positions are applicable, the percentage of valid transitions in our control analysis will be higher than if we don't, potentially tempering conclusions about the effects of item repetitions on recall performance.\n",
    "It's possible that differences in decision-making about these issues helps explain differences in reported outcomes across studies.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here we take the stance that the proper implementation of the null hypothesis treats recall of *either* position in control list trials as a recall of the repeater item they were paired with from the mixed list. This helps examine the question of whether recall rates for the specified study positions really differ if the items in those study positions were identical to one another or distinct. To instead only treat one study position of a repeater item as valid for the control analysis necessarily produces recall rates that are lower than we would obtain under the main analysis, effectively always detecting an effect of item repetitions on recall performance even if participants treated the two study positions as two distinct items across both encoding and recall. \n",
    "\n",
    "Following our methodological commitment, a remaining problem is to determine how to handle recalls of distinct items from control lists that under the control analysis are treated as the same item due to matching study positions with mixed lists. Here, we take the same approach we would take when analyzing mixed lists: we filter out repeated recalls of the same \"item\" when analyzing recall performance across both our main and control analyses. By then conditioning tabulation of transition rates upon whether a given item has already been recalled or not, we can properly focus both versions of the analysis (main and control) on transitions where neither study position has yet been recalled in the current trial."
