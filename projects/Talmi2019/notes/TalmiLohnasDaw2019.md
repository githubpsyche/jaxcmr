[[Moderate Emotional Arousal Enhances Item Memory]]
- [[CahillMcGaugh1998]]

Empirically, current theories of emotional memory fail to predict when enhancement would be exhibited and when it would not.

In particular, simple prioritization fails to account for situations in which emotion does not benefit memory, such as in free recall tests for pure lists of emotional and neutral stimuli (the emotional list-composition effect, described below); 

in immediate recognition tests for mixed lists of emotional and neutral stimuli (Dougal & Rotello, 2007; Sharot & Yonelinas, 2008); 

and in tests of associative memory (Bisby, Horner, Hørlyck, & Burgess, 2016; Madan, Caplan, Lau, & Fujiwara, 2012; Madan, Fujiwara, Caplan, 2012).

Apart from addressing these empirical considerations, retrieved context models suggest a more nuanced normative interpretation. Instead of simply ranking which individual items should be prioritized in isolation, the retrieved context models speak to what sorts of memory structures should be built by encoding associations among these items.

Indeed, these associations themselves have a clear normative interpretation in that the item-context associations at the heart of retrieved context models mathematically correspond to a particular sort of world model for guiding utility-maximizing future choices (Gershman, Moore, Todd, Norman, & Sederberg, 2012).

Retrieved context models also shed light on the distinct question of how memories will be prioritized for retrieval given the goals of the test context (DuBrow, Rouhani, Niv, & Norman, 2017).

In decision making, such modulation of retrieval will promote consideration of particular (emotionally charged) outcomes of candidate actions, and are reminiscent of mechanisms independently proposed in the decision-making literature for rationally prioritized evaluation (Cushman & Morris, 2015; Huys et al., 2012; Lieder, Griffiths, & Hsu, 2018).

> Worth understanding these theoretical ties between RCT and rational decision making and emotion.

Both the Modulated-consolidation model and the Emotional Binding account (Yonelinas & Ritchey, 2015) attribute all of the explanatory power to processes that occur in the hours and days after stimulus encoding is completed.

The former suggests that emotional arousal directly modulates the consolidation of memory traces, a process that can be triggered when emotional stimuli are encoded or when arousal is experienced soon afterward. 

The latter suggests that the arousal experienced at encoding results in attenuated forgetting because of reduced interference from less-common emotional experiences, without influencing consolidation.

Glutamate Amplifies Noradrenergic Effects (GANE) (Mather, Clewett, Sakaki, & Harley, 2016) also proposes a neurobiological mechanism for the effect of arousal and arousal-attention interactions on protein synthesis after encoding is completed.

These models fare well in accounting for the oft-cited finding that the effect of emotion on memory is more robust in delayed, compared with immediate, memory tests (reviewed in Yonelinas & Ritchey, 2015 and earlier by Craik & Blankenstein, 1975) 

and for the effects of stressors on memory for prestress experiences (Shields, Sazma, McCullough, & Yonelinas, 2017).

> Embraces a variant that uses both emotional features and increased attention to emotional items to address memory organization. Call it the attention-categrory variant of eCMR.

The implementation of attention to emotional items in eCMR as increased strength of item-context associations corresponds to evidence that emotional stimuli are more tightly associated to their context. According to the priority-binding hypothesis (Mackay et al., 2004) emotional items are bound more strongly to their presentation context than neutral items. This assertion is evident in that emotional items escape the attentional blink more readily— namely, they are more likely to be reported when presented in a rapid serial visual stream close to a target stimulus—because they are bound better to their encoding context (Anderson, 2005; Mackay, Hadley, & Schwartz, 2005).

Seems to use simulations with fixed parameter configurations to evaluate the model's ability to account for patterns. I don't really like this since it leaves to interpretation why the model works (or fails to work) in a given situation. But it is a start.

neutral ones in the mixed list condition, but their advantage was
diminished, and here nonsignificant, in the pure-list condition
