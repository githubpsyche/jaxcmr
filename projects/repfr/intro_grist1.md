Repetition not only strengthens memory; it also shapes how memories are organized and retrieved within sequences.
Retrieved-context theory (RCT) attributes such organization to a temporal-context signal that drifts across study events, binding each item to the momentary context and later reinstating that stored context to cue sequential recall.
Central to how these mechanisms address repetition effects is the assumption of study-phase retrieval: a second presentation of an item reinstates the contextual features associated with its first occurrence and blends that state into the ongoing context.
Despite RCT's success at explaining many repetition effects and broader recall benchmarks, existing tests of its study-phase retrieval assumption have been narrow and based on imperfect control comparisons.

We re-examined published free- and serial-recall datasets containing item repetitions, comparing memory for lists with item repetitions against control lists without repetitions.
Three observations contradict blended reinstatement.
First, transitions between items that neighboured different presentations of the same word remained at baseline rates, indicating that the two study events reinstated distinct contexts.
Second, after a repeated word was recalled, participants were far more likely to continue with items that followed its first presentation than its later one -- a bias absent in the controls. 
Third, in forward serial recall, participants reliably advanced from a repeated word to the correct next item, whereas CMR predicts frequent jumps to the other presentation's neighbour. 
Likelihood-based fits confirm that CMR fails because it stores highly overlapping contexts and averages them at recall.
A variant that assigns each presentation a distinct context and allows traces to compete for reinstatement captures all effects and improves fit, showing that modelling repetition requires competitive, episode-specific contexts rather than blended ones.

Repetition both strengthens memory and structures how they are organized and retrieved within sequences. 
Retrieved-context theory (RCT) attributes such organization to a temporal-context representation that evolves whenever an item is studied or retrieved, reactivating its previously associated context features and blending them into the ongoing representation.
Item repetition can thus reinstate the contextual features associated with its first occurrence, blending that state into the ongoing context (study-phase retrieval).
Although CMR has successfully captured many memory benchmarks, existing tests of its approach to repetition have been limited in scope and relied on imperfect controls.

We re-examined published free- and serial-recall datasets containing item repetitions, comparing lists featuring repetitions to control lists by matching study positions.
Transitions between items that neighbored different presentations of the same word remained at baseline rates.
Furthermore, after a repeated word was recalled, participants showed a heightened bias toward neighbors of its first presentation relative to controls.
In serial recall, participants progressed from a repeated word to its correct next neighbor at near-perfect rates instead of transitioning near the other presentation.
Likelihood-based fits confirmed that a prominent implementation of RCT -- the Context Maintenance and Retrieval model -- fails on these measures because it stores highly overlapping contexts and averages them upon retrieval.
Variants that assign each presentation distinct contexts and let episode-specific traces compete for reinstatement explained all three results and fit data substantially better, indicating that modeling repetition requires competitive, episode-specific context reinstatement.

Repetition both strengthens memory and shapes how memories are organized and retrieved within sequences. 
Retrieved-context theory (RCT) explains this organization by positing a temporal-context signal that drifts across study events: each item is bound to the prevailing context, and when the item is later encountered or recalled it reactivates its stored contextual features, blends them into the current state, and the updated context then cues further retrieval. 
Under this framework a second presentation is expected to reinstate the context from its first appearance and merge it into the ongoing representation—a process known as study-phase retrieval. Although the Context Maintenance and Retrieval (CMR) model—an implementation of RCT—accounts for many memory benchmarks, its study-phase retrieval assumption has been evaluated only with narrow and imperfect controls.

We re-examined published free- and serial-recall datasets containing item repetitions, comparing lists with repetitions to matched control lists without them. Three patterns challenge blended reinstatement. (1) Transitions between items that neighboured different presentations of the same word occurred at baseline rates, indicating that the two study events reinstated distinct contexts. (2) After a repeated word was recalled, participants were far more likely to continue with items that followed its first presentation than its second—a bias absent in the controls. (3) In serial recall, participants almost always advanced from a repeated word to its correct next neighbour, whereas CMR predicts frequent switches to the other presentation’s neighbour. Likelihood-based fits confirm that standard CMR fails because it stores highly overlapping contexts and averages them at retrieval. A variant that assigns each presentation a distinct context and lets episode-specific traces compete for reinstatement captures all three effects and fits the data substantially better, showing that modelling repetition requires competitive, episode-specific context reinstatement.
