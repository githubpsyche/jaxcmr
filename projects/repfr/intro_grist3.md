Most proposals fall into three classes. 
(1) Contextual‑variability accounts propose that wider spacing lets each encounter bind the item to a more distinct temporal context, increasing the diversity of retrieval cues.
(2) Deficient‑processing accounts argue that massed repeats receive shallow encoding, whereas spaced repeats receive full processing and form stronger traces [@greene1980spacing; @tharp1983effects].
(3) Study-phase-retrieval accounts posit that a later encounter reactivates the contextual state of the earlier one, enabling additional encoding or associative strengthening between the two episodes [@hintzman1974repetition; @roediger2006test].
Although all three explanations can explain the memorial benefits of spaced repetition, they make different claims about the episode‑specific contexts that repetition creates and about how those contexts configure retrieval.
