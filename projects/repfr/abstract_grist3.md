Repetition usually improves recall, but each occurrence of an item is embedded in its own episodic context.
Retrieved-context theory (RCT) predicts that repetitions knit these contexts together: when an item is encoded or retrieved, it reinstates features from prior occurrences, creating blended cues (Howard & Kahana, 2002; Polyn et al., 2009; Lohnas & Kahana, 2014).
Such blending links occurrences across time, but also predicts associative interference across a repeated item’s neighborhoods where one occurrence’s neighbors intrude into another's recall.

To test these predictions, we investigated how the temporal contiguity effect -- the tendency to successively recall items that were studied near each other in time -- manifests when items have multiple occurrences.
We re-examined six free- and serial-recall datasets with matched control baselines.
Three robust patterns emerged that contradict RCT’s interference predictions: (i) no elevated transitions between neighborhoods of different occurrences, (ii) a consistent bias toward the first occurrence’s neighbors rather than balanced access, and (iii) preserved forward chaining in serial recall without cross-occurrence errors.
Together these results indicate that repeated items remain separable in memory, rather than linked by associative blending.
Episodic memory appears to balance integration and specificity not by fusing occurrence contexts, but by letting distinct traces compete at retrieval.
