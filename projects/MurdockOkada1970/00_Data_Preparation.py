> Murdock, B. B., & Okada, R. (1970). Interresponse times in single-trial free recall. Journal of Experimental Psychology, 86(2), 263.  

Authors investigated interresponse times in single-trial free recall. Each of 72 undergraduates was given 20 test lists with 20-word lists visually presented at either 60 or 120 words/min. The format of the data in these files is as follows:  

Row 1: subject/trial information. Trial index, subject index, subject-trial index. I'm not seeing presentation speed.  
Row 2: serial position as a function of output position.  
Row 3: inter-response time as a function of output position  

The code 88 means that the subject made an extra-list intrusion.
