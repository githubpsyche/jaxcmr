Performance characteristics are ambiguous. In last comparison, `vmap` came out on top. But I'm pretty sure that I did another comparison some other time and got the opposite result. I should have a benchmarking notebook and do some research about how the functions work in the background.

I have old code that does a comparison, but it no longer works in the current codebase. I should update it.
