# Murdock 1962

> Murdock Jr, B. B. (1962). The serial position effect of free recall. Journal of experimental psychology, 64(5), 482.

This data is interesting because it manipulates within-subject the length of the lists studied before performing free recall, including list lengths of 20, 30, and 40 words. 
It also exhibits an odd probability of first recall curve, with a plateau of recall probabilities for end-of-list items, which is contrary to CMR's assumption of an exponential decay in recall probability as a function of recency.

We fit the Base CMR model to the Murdock 1962 data, simulated data from the model, and then comparedfit the model to the simulated data by plotting the serial position curves, lag-CRPs, and probability of first recall curves with simulated and actual data.

With these fits, we can evaluate the model's ability to capture performance across list lengths and compare its performane to when the model is fit to the data from each list length separately.
Discrepancies in model performance when fitted across list lengths may indicate deficiencies in the model's account of how list length affects recall performance.

Other research may provide a site for evaluation of new mechanisms for addressing discrepancy recency curves exhibited in this and other datasets.
