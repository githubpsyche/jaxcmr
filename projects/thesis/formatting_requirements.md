# Itemized Changes

Hi, there is no Word doc version of my thesis, so I can't use Track Changes. Instead, here is a list of changes I made to the formatting requirements document:

- Adjusted title page according to guidelines at: https://gradschool.vanderbilt.edu/academics/thesis-dissertation-guidelines/#h2-manuscript-preparation

- Broke up Table 3.1 displaying model fits across free and serial recall datasets into two separate tables (3.1 and 3.2) to avoid overflow
-
