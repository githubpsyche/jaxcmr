# Same item, different traces: Dissecting the structure of memory for repeated experience

What is the structure of memory for repeated experience?
Repeating an item usually strengthens later recall, yet every encounter is embedded in a unique episodic context -- its own temporal moment, surrounding events, and internal state.
A second visit to the same neighbourhood bakery might occur on a chilly afternoon, after an unexpected detour, and in a brighter mood, and those updated circumstances become part of what is stored.
In list-learning experiments, the principle is the same:
If the word *canoe* is studied at serial positions 5 and 15, it becomes linked to two separate stretches of the mental timeline.
How these episode-specific contexts are encoded and reinstated during retrieval determines not only whether and when *canoe* is recalled, but also which other items come next.
Here we ask how repetition reshapes those contextual links and, in turn, the structure of memory search.

The spacing effect -- better memory when repeated encounters are separated by time -- has anchored theories of repetition learning for over a century and remains a decisive benchmark for contemporary models [@ebbinghaus1885; @cepeda2006distributed].
Competing explanations emphasize three mechanisms.
(1) Encoding-variability accounts claim that wider lags bind each encounter to more distinct episodic contexts, broadening applicable retrieval cues [@bower1972coding; @glenberg1979component].
(2) Deficient‑processing accounts hold that massed repeats receive shallow encoding, whereas spaced repeats receive full processing and form stronger traces [@greene1980spacing].
(3) Study‑phase‑retrieval accounts propose that a later encounter reactivates earlier episodes, enabling additional associative learning [@hintzman1974repetition].
All three can account for the spacing advantage, but make distinct predictions about the contextual links that guide subsequent recall.

Within this literature, retrieved‑context theory (RCT) has become an influential framework that addresses repetition effects within an overarching account of episodic memory search [@howard2002distributed].
Implemented first in the Temporal Context Model and elaborated in models such as the Context Maintenance and Retrieval (CMR) [@polyn2009context] and Context Retrieval and Updating (CRU) [@logan2018automatic] frameworks, RCT emphasizes the interaction between studied items and a continuously evolving temporal context.
According to RCT, presenting or recalling an item blends the contextual features tied to it into the ongoing context state to reflect recent experience.
Study events link items to varying states of context, while recall reinstates contextual features associated with the item to provide a contextual cue for the next retrieval attempt.
Retrieved-context theory therefore integrates both contextual variability (spaced repetitions create more distinct contexts) and study-phase retrieval (each repetition reinstates earlier context) mechanisms to address spacing and repetition effects [@siegel2014retrieved].
The same account explains the temporal organization of memory search and reproduces classic signatures such as lag–contiguity gradients, primacy–recency curves, and robust recall after distractor delays [@polyn2009context; @healey2019contiguity].
Extensions of the framework now tackle emotional clustering, continual distraction, and serial‑order transpositions, making RCT one of the most widely applied accounts of episodic retrieval.

Earlier temporal-context theories assumed that the background context drifted gradually and independently of study events, so items were associated with and cued by whatever state happened to prevail [@estes1955statistical; @mensink1989model].
In the Temporal Context Model, @howard2002distributed showed that letting each item reinstate contextual features specific to it across study and retrieval events solved several puzzles at once.
First, it produces the forward-skewed lag-contiguity curve typical in free recall: recalling item $i$ shifts the cue toward the context that preceded item $i + 1$, whereas a symmetric time-only drift predicts a symmetric curve unless an extra asymmetry parameter is added.
Second, because the trace is retrieved at recall, the same recency and contiguity survive long distractors; by contrast, a randomly drifting cue loses those similarities once it has moved on [@sederberg2008context].
Third, when an item reappears after a delay, reinstatement re-encodes it in a partially restored earlier state, adding study-phase retrieval to a process account of spacing and within-list repetition benefits [@siegel2014retrieved].
Extending the same rule across lists explains the graded prior‑list‑intrusion pattern: intrusions cluster in the immediately preceding list and near the target position because those items revive contexts most like the present cue [@howard2008persistence; @lohnas2015expanding]. 
In serial recall, an item‑based update -- realized as a composite blend of associated contexts in CMR or an item-specific contextual feature in CRU -- captures the steep transposition gradient (errors swap neighbouring positions) and the gradual learning observed when a digit sequence is covertly repeated every third trial (the Hebb repetition effect) [@logan2018automatic; @logan2021serial; @lohnas2024retrieved].
Together these successes position item-based context reinstatement as a linchpin of retrieved-context theory's explanatory power.

RCT's item-based context evolution mechanism links occurrences of the same item across time and provides a coherent basis for episodic memory search.
However, the same mechanism can also hamper the ability to retrieve contextual details specific to one occurrence without also retrieving details from the other.
In our bakery example, such associative interference could produce confusion across the details of multiple visits, such as whether the bakery was visited on a rainy day or whether the croissant was fresh.
In list-learning tasks, this associative interference manifests as a tendency for cues that activate neighbors of one occurrence of an item to also activate neighbors of other occurrences.
For example, if the word *canoe* is studied at serial positions 5 and 15, then recalling the first occurrence at position 5 or even the neighbor from position 6 could boost the probability of transitioning to items near the second occurrence at position 15. 
Across most RCT implementations, item-based context evolution produces such associative interference in two ways.
First, reinstating item-specific contextual features each time an item is studied produces overlapping contextual states such that contextual cues for neighbors of one occurrence will also tend to activate neighbors of other occurrences.
Second, reinstating item-specific contextual features at retrieval conversely produces a contextual cue that contacts all neighbors of the item simultaneously.
Either consequence of the mechanism implies that one linked study region cannot be easily cued without also substantially cuing the other.

Here we argue that such associative interference predicted by retrieved‑context theory is scarce across free and serial recall.
Building on prior work that refined RCT's treatment of repetition and mapped it across tasks [@siegel2014retrieved; @polyn2009context; @logan2021serial], we probe three concrete predictions from item-based context evolution as implemented in CMR.
First, in free recall, transitions between the temporal neighbours of two occurrences of the same item should exceed those with matched study positions in control lists without repetitions [@siegel2014retrieved].
Second, because a repeated item reinstates features associated with all occurrences, its neighbours should be contacted in a more balanced, region‑agnostic fashion compared to position-matched distinct items in control lists.
Third, in serial recall, recalling the first occurrence of a repeated item should often propel search to the second occurrence’s neighbours, displacing the correct forward neighbour.
CMR indeed produces all three patterns in simulation. 
Across datasets and analyses, however, we find little matching evidence, contradicting both earlier claims of boosted cross‑occurrence transitions in free recall [@siegel2014retrieved] or of a capability of retrieved-context models to sidestep associative interference errors in serial recall [@logan2021serial]. 
This theory–data gap calls the standard item‑based blending assumption of RCT into question.

In the present work, we find that such associative interference is scarce in memory search tasks such as free and serial recall.
Building on an existing base of work that has clarified RCT's account of repetition effects, extended its application across free and serial recall tasks, and refined organizational analyses of sequential recall performance [@siegel2014retrieved; @polyn2009context; @logan2021serial], we identified and tested three predictions of associative interference in RCT's blended-context implementations using six archival datasets spanning task domains.
First, because overlapping contexts are reinstated at each occurrence of the same item, the probability of transitioning in free recall between neighbors of two occurrences of the same item should be boosted relative to a control list with no repetitions [@siegel2014retrieved].
Second, because retrieving a repeated item reinstates contextual features associated with either occurrence of a repeated item, the probability of transitioning from free recall of repeated item to neighbors of either occurrence should be more balanced across list regions compared to distinct items studied at the same positions in control lists.
Third, in serial recall, these same dynamics should predict that transitions from recall of the first occurrence of a repeated item should frequently erroneously advance to the second occurrence's neighbors, rather than to the first occurrence's forward neighbor.
Other work variously suggest either that retrieved-context models can circumvent interference leaning on residual backward context [@logan2021serial] or alternatively report evidence for boosted cross-neighbor transitions in free recall [@siegel2014retrieved].
By contrast, our simulations confirm that CMR predicts these associative interference patterns, but across datasets and analyses observe little matching evidence.
This mismatch between model prediction and empirical scarcity poses a direct challenge to the prevailing item-based context evolution assumption in RCT as it is typically implemented.

To reconcile these issues, we leverage Instance-CMR, a trace‑based framework that stores each item–context pairing as a separate memory instance. 
Because every encoding rule and parameter of standard CMR can be replicated within Instance-CMR, the framework can be configured to be functionally equivalent to CMR, reproducing its well‑known successes -- and its interference limitation -- with equivalent parameters. 
Crucially, the same architecture lets us swap in alternative assumptions: (a) each repetition reinstates a unique, non‑overlapping contextual feature, and (b) the resulting traces compete for reinstatement at retrieval.
In contrast to CMR and other key RCT implementations, this variant within an instance-based framework can construct contextual associations and contextual retrieval cues that are specific to one occurrence of an item instead of blending support across occurrences.
These changes preserve CMR's fit to classic contiguity and recency effects yet eliminates the boosted associative interference predicted by item-based context evolution.
In doing so, ICMR bridges retrieved‑context theory with the multiple‑trace tradition exemplified by MINERVA 2 and REM [@hintzman1986judgments; @shiffrin1995memory] and recasts episodic memory as a competition between distinct, item-specific contexts rather than a blending of overlapping ones.
The result is a theoretically parsimonious account that balances integration and specificity without adding parameters.

## Theoretical Framework

### Repetition Effects in Sequential Recall Tasks

Present CMR and CRU and retrieved-context theory as a framework for understanding repetition effects in free and serial recall, focusing on providing an updated interpretation of its assumptions that 1) questions the role of study-phase retrieval in addressing spacing effects, and 2) predicts associative interference between repeated items because of its study-phase retrieval mechanism.

Discuss effects in serial recall, applying RCT framework to propose a new account of the effects.

distinguish ranschburg effect as likely a response suppression thing outside the scope of this work.

Focusing on: associative interference in serial recall.

Conversely connect back the problem of associative interference to free recall: just as transition rates from recalls of repeated items to serial neighbors has provided an important constraint for models of serial recall (e.g., ruling out chaining models), we argue that the same is true for free recall.

Propose: CMR's specification of study-phase retrieval is dysfunctional and shares limitations with the chaining model, instantiating associative interference between contextual representations associated with different instances of a repeated item.

### Instance Theory and Selective-Trace Retrieval

Cover literature contrasting instance theory with relevant frameworks, but this time with a focus on how it addresses repetition effects and associative interference.

Focus on analysis by Anderson and otherwise distinguishing classical instance-based model architectures from instance-based retrieval.

Key idea: instance models are best defined in terms of how they retrieve information from memory, rather than their specific implementation: they have the capacity to retrieve specific instances from memory, controlling interference/blending of information across instances.

Key idea: whether a model has this property depends on both the model's architecture and the kinds of representations it uses.

Relate to evidence that humans exhibit this capacity across a variety of tasks that contact memory, including free and serial recall.

Final connection: back to sequential recall. What is instance-based retrieval in the context of serial and free recall? Review existing treatments (e.g., CRU).

We therefore introduce Instance-CMR, a trace-storage implementation of RCT that can toggle alternative assumptions.

## Methods and Materials

### Archival Datasets

Just control lists:
- Healey Kahana 2024

Free recall with mixed+control lists:
- Lohnas & Kahana (2014)
- Lohnas & Kahana (2024)

Free recall without control lists:
- Broitman Kahana 2024

Serial recall with mixed+control lists:

One more serial recall dataset with control lists would be nice, but this is enough for thesis.

### Sequence-Based Likelihood Fitting
To compare models we compute the log‑likelihood of each observed recall sequence given a fitted parameter set.

### Generative Performance Assessment
Once parameters are fitted, we can generate synthetic datasets for benchmarking.

### Defining Repetition Effects

What exactly counts as a repetition effect? 
It is tempting to say that any change in recall that follows multiple presentations of an item qualifies.
Yet that definition confounds two influences: (i) the ordinary consequences of exposing participants to additional study material and (ii) the special consequences of encountering the same material twice.
We reserve the term **repetition effect** for the second influence alone. 
Formally, it is the difference in recall performance that arises when a study event is a re-presentation of an earlier item rather than the first appearance of a new item presented in the same serial position.
This definition invokes a counter‑factual baseline:
*What would performance look like if the memory system processed the repetition in exactly the same way it would have processed a novel token, differing only in the arbitrary fact that the stimulus label is repeated?* 
The difference between that baseline and observed performance constitutes the repetition effect proper.

The baseline cannot be observed directly, so it must be estimated.
Following the serial-position-matching strategy of @siegel2014retrieved, we build it by pairing each mixed‑list trial with many control‑list trials of identical length and presentation schedule.
With every control list we designate the items occupying the repeater's two positions ($i$, $j$) as pseudo‑repeaters, and recompute the target statistic. 
Repeating the analysis over 100 samples yields a null distribution that estimates performance under the no‑special‑status hypothesis -- that is, when the memory system treats the two positions as independent study events differing only in label.

A further decision determines how recalls from those matched positions are scored. 
Just as the two occurrences of *canoe* in a mixed list are handled as a single item when recall performance is analyzed, so too must the two positions in control lists matched to repeaters from mixed lists.
Any analytic step that ignores that identity relation in the control lists distorts characterization of the null hypothesis.
We therefore adopt a symmetric scoring rule: a recall from *either* matched position counts as a recall of the pseudo‑repeater.
A second recall of either position is treated as a repeated recall of the same item, and normally ignored during tabulation of transition statistics.
Alternative conventions -- e.g., scoring only one position, tallying the two positions independently, or requiring retrieval of both positions to count as a successful recall -- can lower the baseline and inflate the apparent size of repetition effects.
Such analytic choices, rather than psychological mechanisms, may underlie some discrepancies in our findings compared to earlier work.

Our procedure therefore combines (i) serial‑position matching to preserve temporal structure and (ii) explicitly symmetric scoring to preserve logical identity.
Comparison of performance in mixed lists to this symmetric baseline yields a clean isolation of genuine repetition effects.
When applied in the analyses that follow, it markedly attenuates or eliminates patterns characterized as repetition effects in earlier work.
By defining repetition effects in explicit counter-factual terms and operationalizing that definition with a rigorously matched control procedure, we obtain a cleaner test bed for the predictions of competing instantiations of retrieved-context theory.
